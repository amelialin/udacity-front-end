You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?

How to strikethrough text and superscript text in HTML, which I did not know before.

  * What has been easy?

I have some background knowledge of HTML so the basic tags and structure are familiar.

  * What has been difficult?

Not too much so farâ€¦mostly just getting used to the Udacity interface is a little tricky.

  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

I Googled to figure out which tags to use!
